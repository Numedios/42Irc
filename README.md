# ft_irc

## Description

The objective of this project is to write a custom IRC server working with a real IRC client. 

IRC is one of the earliest network protocols for text messaging and multi-participant chatting. It remains a popular standard and still sees heavy use in certain communities, specially the open source software community.

Internet is ruled by solid and standards protocols that allow a strong interaction between every connected computer. Hence our IRC server will have to respect these protocols.

## Introduction

Internet Relay Chat or IRC is a textual communication protocol on the Internet. It is instantaneous communication mainly in the form of discussions in groups via discussion channels, but can also be used for one-to-one communication.

IRC client programs connect to an IRC server to access a specific channel. IRC servers are connected between them to provide a global network with unique channels.
